# PandasTestProject1

It is a test project, where I use data from open sources.

I carried out various manipulations with the data: 
* Data cleaning,
* Found the highest profit by month,
* Found the city where the products were ordered the most,
* Found products are most often sold togather,
* Found a pattern in the cost of products and their ordered quantity.
